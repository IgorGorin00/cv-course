This repo contains all notebooks that i have written during Deep learning with pythorch - zero to GANs course 
[youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbm3T2Eq1_KgloC7ogdXxdRa), 
[jovian.ml link](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/collections/deep-learning-with-pytorch).

The course overall was focused on image processing, classification, etc. This repo also contains a bunch
of notebooks focused on cycle-gans, which were not part of course, but i includud them cuz they kinda fit the topic
of computer vision. 

`classification/` directory contains notebooks devoted to image classification
`GANs_and_CycleGANs/` directory contains nobooks devoted to generative adversarial networs, and cycle generative adversarial networks

Although it might seem, like notebooks contain a lot of copypasted code, in fact i was always 
rewriting it by hand in order to remember the code linked to particular problem.
